# Jira

## Overview

JupiterOne provides a managed integration with Jira. The integration connects
directly to Jira APIs to obtain project information and issues.

## Integration Instance Configuration

The integration is triggered by an event containing the information for a
specific integration instance.

Customers authorize access by creating a Jira user and providing the username
and password (or [API token][2] when passwords require MFA) to JupiterOne for
HTTP Basic Auth as described in the [Jira Security for Other Integrations][1]
documentation.

## Entities

The following entity resources are ingested when the integration runs:

| Jira Resource | \_type of the Entity | \_class of the Entity |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Account       | `jira_account`       | `Account`             |
| Project       | `jira_project`       | `Project`             |
| User          | `jira_user`          | `User`                |
| Issue \*      | `jira_issue`         | `Record`              |

(\*) The integration ingests issues up to a year prior to the date of execution.
Issues ingested are kept as records, such that issues older than a year that
were previously ingested will remain in the graph when integration runs again.
Issues are deleted only when the integration instance is deleted, along with
other entities associated with the integration instance.

## Relationships

The following relationships are created/mapped:

| From           | Type         | To             |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| `jira_account` | **HAS**      | `jira_project` |
| `jira_project` | **HAS**      | `jira_issue`   |
| `jira_user`    | **CREATED**  | `jira_issue`   |
| `jira_user`    | **REPORTED** | `jira_issue`   |

## Pro Tips

In Jira, if you create custom issue types and use one of the following, the
integration will parse and translate them to the corresponding entity class:

- `Change` (this also maps when the issue key starts with `PRODCM`)
- `Finding`
- `Incident`
- `Risk`
- `Vulnerability`
